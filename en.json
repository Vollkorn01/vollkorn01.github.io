"lp_header4": "Our journey to reduce 1 billion PET-bottles",
"lp_text4": "The idea of founding a company together to fight the extensive use of single-use plastic came up at a family dinner. Luca told Alex about his recent pain point that every time he wants a flavoured drink while commuting, he relies on a single-use plastic bottle even though he has his reusable bottle with him. In the following month Alex recognized the extent of the problem at a Beach Clean-up in Ghana and once he returned, he was very excited to start project ‚Äúfountain‚Äù and tackle the plastic problem. Eager to make a change we started building our first prototypes and tested them with different organizations where it became evident that we are not the only ones ready for a change towards more circularity.",

Soon enough at a family dinner Alex & Luca discussed the news and the seed was planted. Alex went to a trip to Ghana for a Beach Cleanup where he recognized the extent of the plastic problem. Once back in Switzerland, Alex & Luca sat together to discuss project ‚Äúfountain‚Äù and a few weeks later, the first prototype made out of cardboard was ready to test if there are other people that can relate with our mission. Since then we got a mission - reducing plastic waste & creating a real impact!",
